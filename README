Compile should just be "make all" (this creates host, .xclbin according to TARGET and PLATFORM variable in Makefile and emconfig.json with emconfigutil) inside the build directory.

Running is then "./host -xclbin hw_kernels.xclbin" file.

I have tested this in sw_emu localy, in hw_emu on threadripper.
